## Commit message format: ``` severity: Header sentence Body paragraph. Mentioning issue ID ``` **severity**: minor, major, critical<br> **mentioning** must contains keywords: closes, fixes, resolves ### Example: ``` minor: Add new connector It adds new connector to connect DB. Closes #1 ``` **NOTE:** If you commit a change that should not be merged so far, add "WIP" to the first line to prevent merging unfinished work. Example: ``` WIP minor: Add new connector It adds new connector to connect DB. Closes #1 ``` ## Workflow 1. Choose a new task (issue) on the [project board](https://github.com/users/JanMate/projects/2) and move it into "**In progress**" column. 2. Open the repo related to your chosen task in your IDE and pull and rebase onto **origin main** branch. ```shell git pull --rebase origin main ``` 3. For **every task** create a **new branch** that's based on **main** branch. - Example: - Task says: `Implement logic layer of core application...` - Branch name should be similar to: `implement-logic-layer` (concat the words with dash "-") ```shell git checkout -b <branch-name> ``` 4. Commit your change. (Please, split your changes on logical parts if it's possible and makes sense.) ```shell git commit -am ``` If you forget something, you can use: ```shell git commit --amend ``` 7. Since you are done with the task or want to back up your changes, push your commits to the **origin**. ```shell git push origin <branch-name> ``` 8. After push step, create a new Pull Request (PR) in the repo Web UI to request merging of your branch into **main** branch. 1. Open GitHub repo in your browser 2. Either, on homepage or in "Pull requests" page hit the "New pull request" button 3. Choose [JanMate](https://github.com/JanMate) as a reviewer 4. Choose yourself as an assignee 5. If you are not done and want to proceed with the task (due to back up), **select** the PR as "Draft" 9. If you need to update your PR, you must force push your commits. ```shell git push --force origin <branch-name> ```
